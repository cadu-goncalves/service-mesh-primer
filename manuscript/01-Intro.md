# Intro

Microservices are still the most hyped approach to software
architecture. That has led to a huge number of new technologies to
support microservices. [Docker](https://www.docker.com) for instance is a great
tool to package microservices in self-contained images and to run many
microservices on a single machine, but with separate file systems and
network interfaces. [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) runs Docker
containers in a cluster and enables load balancing as well as fail
over. It also adds features like service discovery and
routing. Nowadays, Kubernetes has become a very important
infrastructure technology and has use cases far beyond
microservices.

Thus, microservices lead to a lot of innovation for
infrastructures. Service meshes are the latest infrastructure
development to support microservices even better. This primer gives an
overview of service meshes -- it describes not just the concepts, but also explains why
service meshes are useful and which implementations exist. It
even includes a hands-on example for trying out a service mesh.

If you are interested in the concepts of microservices, there is also
the free [Microservices
Primer](https://microservices-book.com/primer.html) and the
[Microservices Book](https://microservices-book.com/primer.html). The
free [Microservices
Recipes](https://practical-microservices.com/recipes.html) booklet
talks about some other technologies for implementing microservices as does
the [Pratical Microservices](https://practical-microservices.com/)
book.
