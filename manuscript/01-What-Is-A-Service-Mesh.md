# What is a Service Mesh? {#chapter-what}

A Service Mesh is a dedicated infrastructure component that facilitates observing, controlling, and securing communication between services. Unlike earlier approaches such as Enterprise Service Buses (ESBs) or API Gateways, a service mesh embraces the distributed nature of modern microservice applications and only focuses on networking rather than business concerns. 

## Architecture

A Service Mesh is composed of two layers, the *data plane* and the *control plane*. The *data plane* consists of a a number of service proxies, each deployed alongside every microservice instance. This is called the *sidecar pattern*: Capabilities that every service needs are extracted to an additional container (the sidecar) that is placed next to every service instance. Up to now, typical use cases for a sidecar have been basic monitoring and encryption of network connections. Therefore, a service proxy was deployed as a sidecar which intersects all network traffic. The configuration of these service proxy sidecar containers and any update to it had to be performed manually. In a service mesh, the service proxies, that make up the data plane, are configured automatically by the second layer of a service mesh: the *control plane*. Any change to the behavior of the service mesh configured by the developer is applied to the control plane and automatically distributed to the service proxies. As shown in [figure 2.1](#fig-what-architecture), the control plane also processes telemetry data that is collected by the service proxies.

This architecture adds powerful features like monitoring, circuit breaking, canary releasing, and automatic mTLS (mutual TLS authentication) to a microservice application without the need to change a single line of application code.

## Service Mesh Interface {#section-what-interface}

The attention - or rather hype - has resulted is a multitude of service mesh implementations, each introducing different concepts and APIs. Meanwhile, a service mesh also turned out to be a suitable base for more advanced tools like

- [Flagger](https://flagger.app), for automating canary releasing, 
- [Squash](https://squash.solo.io), a debugging tool for running microservices, and
- [Kiali](https://www.kiali.io), a service mesh dashboard.

The diverse landscape of service mesh implementations forced tool developers and users to bind to a specific service mesh. This led Microsoft, HashiCorp, Buoyant, and Solo.io to create [Service Mesh Interface](https://smi-spec.io) (SMI), an API specification for service mesh features. Users and tools binding to SMI will be able to use service mesh features independently of the implementation. Although SMI is still young, adapters implementing a part of SMI already exist for the three major service meshes Linkerd 2, Istio, and Consul.
