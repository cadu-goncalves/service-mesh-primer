# What is a Service Mesh? {#chapter-what}

A Service Mesh is a dedicated infrastructure component that facilitates observing, controlling, and securing communication between services. Unlike earlier approaches such as Enterprise Service Buses (ESBs) or API Gateways, a service mesh embraces the distributed nature of modern microservice applications. 

A Service Mesh is composed of two layers, the data plane and the control plane. The *data plane* consists of a a number of service proxies, each deployed alongside every microservice instance. This is called the *sidecar pattern*: Capabilities that every service needs are extracted to an additional container (the sidecar) that is placed next to every service instance. Up to now, typical use cases for a sidecar have been basic monitoring and encryption of network connections. Therefore, a service proxy was deployed as a sidecar which intersects all network traffic. The configuration of these service proxy sidecar containers and any update to it had to be done manually. In a service mesh the service proxies, that make up the data plane, are configured automatically by the second layer of a servie mesh: the *control plane*. Any change to the behaviour of the service mesh configured by the developer is applied to the control plane and automatically distributed to the service proxies. As shown in [figure 1](#01-architecture), the control plane also processes telemetry data that is collected by the service proxies.

This architecture adds powerful features like monitoring, circuit breaking, canary releasing, and automatic mTLS (mutual TLS authentication) to a microservice application without the need to change a single line of application code.
