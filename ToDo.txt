- Create cross references from chapter 3 to chapter 2 (example).

- Mention optimizations i.e. async communication in the control plane

- At the moment, the example chapter explains the circuit
  breaker. Should that stay this way or shall we change it?

- We could add the challenges, advantages, and conclusion that the
  "Practical Microservices" book mentions in chapter 23 to the
  conclusion.

- Maybe add something about "Service Meshes beyond microservices"?

- Add additional example to "Example" in the "How to Dig Deeper" section.


- Add Kiali to the example?

- Istio Alternatives and their differences (Linkerd 2, Consul, AWS App Mesh)

- Service Mesh Interface

- Tools on Top of Service Mesh: KubeCost, Flagger, Solo.io Tools, Dashboards (Kiali)

- Mesh Expansion / Multicluster / Non-K8s Environment with Service Mesh
